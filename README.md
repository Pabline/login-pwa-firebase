> Login app to test auth and PWA

For this project I have opted to choice Vue and pwa template to do more easy the develop of a PWA and Firebase to implement a fast auth logic.

You can test de app [here](https://login-pwa-91589.web.app/#/)

With the next user to test:

*User:* prueba@pwa.com
*Pass:* pwa1234

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# Configure a Firebase app with email authentication and set the firebase config on main.js

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit
```
